                        <p class="card-text">This is a static website generator written in Python. The goal of the
                            project is to create a tool that allows me to
                            easily update my portfolio website as needed in an algorithmic way.
                            <br><br>
                            The program takes in a JSON object and a template HTML page; the JSON object contains all of
                            the customizable
                            information necessary to build each page of the site, and the program uses that data to
                            populate specified fields in the
                            template. The JSON is structured in a way that allows me to easily update both individual
                            pages and the entire site
                            structure without having to worry about manually (and accurately) updating the navbar in
                            every HTML file or other
                            similar things.
                            <br><br>
                            This project was originally inspired by Hakyll, ( <a
                                href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/</a> ) a tool that uses
                            Haskell to generate
                            static sites. (Although, without having actually used Hakyll, I imagine it is much more
                            robust than my project.) I have
                            much less experience using Haskell, however, and in fact I originally attempted to make this
                            using OCaml, but I felt
                            that the functional side of things was getting a little too far away from me. While I love
                            functional programming,
                            sometimes I just want to use Python because of how intuitive it is.

                        <p class="card-text">Modified a script for the NASA Planetary Data System Small Bodies Node at
                            the University of Maryland that determines
                            "single" observations of a comet from an observatory.
                            <br><br>
                            The original script was created by Nikki Tjiputra for the Small Bodies Node. It uses data
                            from SBN's local PostgreSQL
                            database and, based on time elapsed between observations of a single object, determines
                            whether or not those groupings
                            of observations should be considered one single observation. This was originally only done
                            for observatory C51-NEOWISE.
                            <br><br>
                            My task was to generalize the script to do the same thing for every observatory separately.
                            Due to the way data is
                            represented in SBN's database, this required many modifications in order to process the data
                            correctly while maintaining
                            differences between observatories. Given the much larger amount of data being processed, I
                            also had to make numerous

                            the University of Maryland that converts from
                            the "new" IAU comet designation system to the "old" IAU comet designation system.
                            <br><br>
                            The script uses Central Bureau Electronic Telegrams (CBETs) in order to obtain the necessary
                            data. The CBETs were
                            downloaded automatically by an existing IDL script provided by the project leader and
                            subsequently parsed by this Python
                            script.
                            <br><br>
                            The script iterates through each CBET and looks for specific words or combinations of words
                            in order to determine the
                            relevancy of each file. Then, based on relevancy, it parses each CBET for various orbital
                            element information that is
                            then used to determine whether a comet should be listed as periodic or not and to propose
                            what name should be given to
                            that comet under the old designation system's rules.
                            <br><br>
                            This script serves to automate part of the process of converting designations; while making
                            the process fully automatic
                            would likely be impossible, the upcoming first lights of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and
                            NEO Surveyor are expected to
                            result in an influx of comet discoveries that will make this process overwhelmingly
                            difficult to continue doing entirely
                            manually. This script will automate a significant part of this work in order to make the
                            rest of the process manageable
                            for one person to continue to do. This project will allow researchers to continue to
                            cross-reference comet names between
                            the new and old systems well into the future.

                            The first two were scatter
                            plots, showing starting frequency over time and ending frequency over time, respectively.
                            The third plot was a bar plot
                            and showed all four combinations of the number of solar flares with halos and the top fifty
                            solar flares. The fourth
                            plot showed the number of strong and weak solar flares over time in an attempt to establish

                            This project dealt heavily with the notion of compile-time environments and variable
                            scoping. In order to implement the
                            differences between Racket's "let" and "let*" expressions, specific attention had to be
                            given to proper use of the stack
                            in order to avoid any memory-related issues and to ensure consistency of features with
                            Racket's implementations. Careful
                            attention also had to be given to stack discipline regarding other parts of the project; to
                            avoid being overwritten,
                            values were often placed in the stack. Additionally, features implemented in "Dupe Plus" (a

                            in CMSC430) had to be altered in order to work with these new environments.
