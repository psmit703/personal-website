            <p>The code I have written for this site ( <a
                    href="https://github.com/psmit703/personal-website/tree/main">github.com/<wbr>psmit703/<wbr>personal-website/<wbr>tree/<Wbr>main</a>
                ) makes limited use of non-identifiable information:
            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="/">Home Page</a> uses JavaScript to determine the height and width
                    (in pixels) of the
                    user's browser window in order to determine whether or not to display an image. If the aspect ratio
                    is too small, then no image is displayed. This is done to create, in my opinion, a better aesthetic
                    on mobile devices. All of the processing is done by the user's browser and nothing is stored or sent
                    back to me (Pete Smith) in any way.
                </li>
                <li>The <a href="/changelog.html">Changelog Page</a> uses JavaScript to retrieve
                    recent commits to the site's GitHub repository. It does this by interacting with GitHub's REST API
                    through Octokit.js, which itself is maintained by GitHub and is GitHub's official way of interacting
                    with their REST API. The code that I have written processes solely on the user's browser and nothing
                    is stored or sent back to me (Pete Smith) in any way. However, as this interacts with GitHub's REST
                    API, I cannot guarantee that anything related to data-privacy is true regarding GitHub. Please see
                    GitHub's privacy policy ( <a
                        href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">docs.github.com/<wbr>en/<wbr>site-policy/<wbr>privacy-policies/<wbr>github-privacy-statement</a>
                    ) for more information.
                </li>
                <li>The <a href="/404.html">Error 404 Page</a> uses JavaScript to determine the URL
                    that a user has inputted. As this page is an error page, the URL is used in a message displayed to
                    the user. All of the processing is done by the user's browser and nothing is stored or sent back to
                    me (Pete Smith) in any way.
                </li>
                <li>Every page uses JavaScript for certain navigation bar features. There are three scripts that control
                    this
                    behavior:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first, which controls whether the navigation bar is visible, uses JavaScript to
                            determine whether or not a user is scrolling and where the mouse is relative to the
                            browser's
                            viewport. These are used to determine whether or not the navigation bar should be displayed.
                            All of the processing is done by the user's browser and nothing is stored or sent back to me
                            (Pete Smith) in any way.
                        </li>
                        <li>The second script controls the navigation bar menu animation when the site is viewed in
                            mobile format. This script uses JavaScript to determine whether or not a user has clicked
                            (or pressed for touchscreens) the navigation bar menu icon. This is used to apply a CSS
                            rotation animation to the menu icon. This script also controls whether or not a click/press
                            will close the navbar menu in mobile format. If the navbar menu is open and the site is
                            being viewed in mobile format, then clicking/pressing outside of the navbar menu will close
                            the navbar menu. All of the processing is done by the user's browser and nothing is stored
                            or sent back to me (Pete Smith) in any way.
                        </li>
                        <li>The third script controls the text alignment of navbar items. The default state is
                            center-alignment, which appears in desktop mode. This allows for the bold effect of the
                            active page to expand both to the left and the right, rather than just the right. However,
                            in mobile format, center-alignment would make it centered relative to the screen. As such,
                            this script uses JavaScript to change the navbar items to left-aligned when the site is
                            viewed in mobile format. All of the processing is done by the user's browser and nothing is
                            stored or sent back to me (Pete Smith) in any way.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The entire site has a toggleable dark mode. Dark mode is automatically enabled/disabled depending on
                    a user's device settings. If a user manually toggles dark mode on or off, this preference is stored
                    using a cookie. This cookie is set to expire automatically after 30 days. Additionally, there is a
                    clickable option at the bottom of each page that allows a user to manually delete this cookie. The
                    cookie is stored on the user's device, all of the processing is done by the user's browser, and
                    nothing is sent back to me (Pete Smith) in any way.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Other than what has already been stated on this page, the code I have written for this site does not
            process, store,
            or otherwise use any user data in any way and does not otherwise use cookies. However, this
            site makes use of various third party
            software that may do so. The following are short summaries of relevant privacy statements and
            links to their respective privacy policies, where applicable:</p>

                        <li>Bootstrap does not appear to have a privacy policy, and, as far as I am aware, the service
