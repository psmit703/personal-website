            <p>The code I have written for this site ( available here: <a
                    href="https://github.com/psmit703/personal-website/tree/main">github.com/psmit703/personal-website/tree/main</a>
                ) makes limited use of non-identifiable information:
            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="https://www.psmit.dev">Home Page</a> uses JavaScript to determine the height and width
                    (in pixels) of the
                    user's browser window in order to determine whether or not to display an image. If the aspect ratio
                    is too small, then no image is displayed. This is done to create, in my opinion, a better aesthetic
                    on mobile devices. All of the processing is done by the user's browser and nothing is stored or sent
                    back to me (Pete Smith) in any form.
                </li>
                <li>The <a href="https://www.psmit.dev/404.html">Error 404 Page</a> uses JavaScript to determine the URL
                    that a user has inputted. As this page is an error page, the URL is used in a message displayed to
                    the user. All of the processing is done by the user's browser and nothing is stored or sent back to
                    me (Pete Smith) in any form.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The code I have written does not otherwise process, store, or use any user data in any form and does not use
            cookies.
            However, this
            site makes use of various third party
