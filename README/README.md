#### A personal portfolio website for all things Pete Smith
#### [Repo Link](https://github.com/psmit703/personal-website)

Welcome to my portfolio! The following is a brief description of software/services used in the site, along with a general description of each page. All URLs listed can either be accessed with or without the "www" subdomain and with or without a "/" at the end. URLs without the "www" subdomain will automatically redirect to

    https://www.psmit.dev

The relative directories (e.g., "/index.html" in "Home | /index.html" in the section headers of this file) link to their respective files in the [main branch](https://github.com/psmit703/personal-website/tree/main) of the [Github repo](https://github.com/psmit703/personal-website). For questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to either [create an issue in this repo](https://github.com/psmit703/personal-website/issues) or email me directly at [psmit703@outlook.com](mailto:psmit703@outlook.com).



#### Sitewide | [Main Repo Branch (Live Site Files)](https://github.com/psmit703/personal-website/tree/main)
This is a general overview of technologies (except HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) found in or otherwise utilized by many or all of this site's pages.
* Bootstrap
    * Bootstrap is a free, open-source CSS framework that eases the frontend development process and allows for a high degree of responsiveness when viewing sites on different devices (e.g., computers, phones, etc.)
    * This site heavily utilizes the Bootstrap CSS framework for its stylization and responsiveness
    * One of Bootstrap's main criticisms, that creating unique webpages with it is difficult, was addressed through a custom CSS file on my part ( /assets/css/styles.css )
    * This site specifically uses Bootstrap 4.3.1
* GitHub Pages
    * GitHub Pages is a service offered by GitHub that allows people to host sites for free in a secure and relatively simple way
    * This site is hosted by GitHub pages in my repository ( psmit703/personal-website )
    * GitHub Pages' configuration settings were also used as part of the DNS configuration and securty certificate process



#### Home | [/index.html](https://github.com/psmit703/personal-website/blob/main/index.html)
This is my site's home page; it can be accessed at either

    https://www.psmit.dev

or

    https://www.psmit.dev/index.html

and contains my general background and some useful information regarding my programming skills. It also has links to my professional profiles (GitHub and LinkedIn), along with my email address.



#### Résumé | [/resume.html](https://github.com/psmit703/personal-website/blob/main/resume.html)
This page displays both my technical and humanities résumés and can be accessed at

    https://psmit.dev/resume.html



#### Coding | [/coding.html](https://github.com/psmit703/personal-website/blob/main/coding.html)
The coding page is where the various coding projects I have worked on are available. The page can be accessed at

    https://psmit.dev/coding.html

and contains descriptions of each project. Some projects have options to view the code in their respective GitHub repositories, while others (specifically school-related projects) have options to contact me. Academic integrity guidelines prohibit me from making the code for each project publicly available, however recruiters, employers, etc. are welcome to contact me so that I can send copies privately.

There are currently no projects listed that do not have publicly- or privately-available code. These may arise in the future based on employers' discretion and may either be temporary or permanent.



#### Writing | [/writing.html](https://github.com/psmit703/personal-website/blob/main/writing.html)
The writing page is where all of my writing samples are and can be accessed at

    https://psmit.dev/writing.html



#### Error 404 | [/404.html](https://github.com/psmit703/personal-website/blob/main/404.html)
As the name suggests, this is my site's "Error 404" page. It is displayed whenever a user attempts to access a page on the site that does not exist. Alternatively, it can be accessed directly at

    https://www.psmit.dev/404.html

In addition to the previously discussed technologies, /404.html makes use of a (very short) custom JavaScript file ( /assets/js/404.js ). The JS file is used for pulling the current URL and displaying it to the user.
