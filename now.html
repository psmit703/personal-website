                <ul>
                    <li><b>Reading:</b> I'm currently reading <i>The Hard Way</i> by Lee Child - one of the Jack
                        Reacher books. I
                        haven't read a Reacher book in a little while, and I forgot how exciting they are. I've also
                        been reading <i>The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue</i> by V. E. Schwab, which is one of the most
                        beautiful books I've ever read. I actually started <i>Addie LaRue</i> last summer, but I overdid
                        it with my courseload last fall and got completely burned out (and had zero free time anyway) so
                        I'm slowly getting to a point where I can actually finish the book.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Washington, D.C.:</b> I've been absolutely loving walking around DC and exploring the city.
                        The Sculpture Garden is my
                        favorite place right now, although I've been enjoying Dupont Circle recently as well. Normally I
                        just like to go and read a book, drink some coffee, and maybe get some lunch while I'm there. I
                        also went to the Pride Parade in DC this past Saturday, which was a lot of fun (thank you
                        DMV weather for not raining).
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Photography:</b> I've been taking a lot of pictures on my phone recently. UMD's campus is
                        absolutely beautiful when the trees have leaves on them, and DC has so much beautiful
                        architecture - it sort of feels wrong <i>not</i> to take pictures all the time. I've been
                        posting a few on social media, however I'm currently trying to figure out a
                        reliable way
                        to be able to display them here without making the site's GitHub repo too big or anything. I've
                        been playing around with nginx on an AWS Lightsail instance, but there's still some
                        configuration stuff that I need to work out first before I can use it to host my photos.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Music:</b> I've been listening to a lot of David Bowie recently. I mean <i>a lot</i>. I've
                        also been listening to a lot of The Last Dinner Party and Chappell Roan this year. Some specific
                        songs (not by any of those artists) that I've been obsessed with recently are "Close to You" by
                        Gracie Abrams and "Moon Girl" by Ha Vay. There's also the odd mix of classical trumpet
                        solos/excerpts, and <i>A Love Supreme</i> by John Coltrane has been one of my favorite albums to
                        listen to over the past month or so. Fun fact: I've been naming some of my papers for school
                        after various songs/albums - check out my <a href="/writing">Writing Samples</a> and see if you
                        can find them!
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Academics:</b> I'm finishing up my undergrad at UMD College Park and will be
                        graduating in December with a B.S. in Computer Science, B.A. in History, and Minor in Trumpet
                        Performance! I'm looking forward to being done, but I'm also not particularly looking
                        forward to working for the next 40-or-however-many-years :/
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Academics, cont.:</b> On that note, I have been developing an increasing interest in
                        programming language theory. I took a compilers class last fall and a runtime verification class
                        this past spring and absolutely loved both of them. I'm probably doing an independent study this
                        upcoming fall on property-based testing, however that hasn't been finalized yet. Perhaps this
                        will give me an excuse to not fully launch my career yet and instead go to grad school for a
                        bit? I guess we'll just have to see.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Misc.:</b> I've been thinking about starting a blog for a while now. I love breakfast
                        sandwiches, so one thought I had was to review breakfast sandwiches in the DMV.
                        I'm also going to start playing trumpet and riding my bike again - I haven't done either since
                        last summer for various reasons, but trumpet is always fun and there's some great bike
                        trails not too far away that I used to go on a lot. Now I just have to try not to crash my bike
                        again.
